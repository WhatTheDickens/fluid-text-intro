# Editorial Intro to *Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition*

[*Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition*](http://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/) is an edition of Henry David Thoreau's *Walden* based on Ronald E. Clapper's 1967 dissertation "The Development of *Walden*: A Genetic Text." It's a project of [Digital Thoreau](http://digitalthoreau.org).

Thoreau revised *Walden* many times across the seven draft versions he composed between 1847 and 1854. Ronald Clapper revised his dissertation, which tracks Thoreau's revisions, when he re-typed it as digital text in the 1980s.

[*Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition*](http://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/) further revises Clapper's dissertation by encoding the information in [TEI](http://tei-c.org).

The editorial introduction to [*Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition*](http://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/) is bound to undergo revision over time. It's a fluid text, too. Because, what text isn't? The purpose of this repository is to make it possible for users to track substantive revisions to the introduction.
