# Editorial Intro to *Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition*

[*Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition*](http://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/) is an edition of Henry David Thoreau's *Walden* based on Ronald E. Clapper's 1967 dissertation "The Development of *Walden*: A Genetic Text." It's a project of [Digital Thoreau](http://digitalthoreau.org)

Thoreau revised *Walden* many times across the seven draft versions he composed between 1847 and 1854. Ronald Clapper revised his dissertation, which tracks Thoreau's revisions, when he re-typed it as digital text in the 1980s.

[*Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition*](http://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/) further revises Clapper's dissertation by encoding the information in [TEI](http://tei-c.org).

The editorial introduction to [*Walden: A Fluid-Text Edition*](http://digitalthoreau.org/fluid-text-toc/) is bound to undergo revision over time. It's a fluid text, too. Because, what text isn't? The purpose of this repository is to make it possible for users to track *substantive* revisions to the introduction.

The 'html' folder holds the most recent version of the introduction in html. To read it, download it and open it in a browser window. Because the file is simply the 'text' view of a section of the WordPress page where the introduction lives, some formatting will be lost.

The 'md' folder holds a copy of the same file written in Markdown, so you can read it right here. You'll see some formatting irregularities here, as well. But you should be able to see what changed since the previous commit.
